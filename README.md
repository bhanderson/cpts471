Computational Genomics
This repo is [Andrew Bates](https://github.com/andrewbates09 "his repo") and my implementation of Ananth Kalyanaraman's Cpt_S 471 Computational Genomics Class.

#Project 1
This project was written entirely by me in c and implements a dynamic programming table to find the best alignment of two sequences either global or local with a given score.

#Project 2
This progect was written by both of us implementing Mccreight's linear time algorithm for suffix tree generation using suffix likns.
